# Extended Space 
This in-progress iPhone app is for my senior project at UCSD. I am composing an 8-channel surround sound composition based off of the work of LaMonte Young and similar artists in the sound art field. Each speaker will be playing its own looping audio at a volume that isn’t loud enough to be heard in the entire space. These loops will be different lengths in the range of 15 to 60 minutes. The idea is to create a large set of possible combinations so that each time you view the work you will have a different experience. Instead of having physical speakers, however, I am using openAL to simulate the space by using panning, HRTF, and location attenuation.

The goal is to eventually include location tracking in the app through iBeacon, Apple’s bluetooth mesh network. This allows the user to walk through the space the work is presented in and experience the piece as if there were physical speakers present in the space.
